        "startIntroPart1": "All hail to Otto von Bismarck, first chancellor of Germany and its empire! During the ancient era, Germany was a land fragmented in several tribes but already showed great promise as the Roman Empire itself struggled to bend the Germans to its will. Germany, as one nation, was slowly built on the ruins of the Holy Roman Empire, and waited 1871 to be finally unified after the glorious victory on France and Napoleon III. The German people are creative, intelligent, industrious and proven to be talented warriors through history. Despite great catastrophes and failures in the first half of the 20th century, Germany can always rely on its people will and strength to be among the greatest and powerful nations in the world.",
